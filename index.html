    <h2>How to use this fuckass guide</h2>
    <p>Recipes are split into three parts. The button, the output, and the steps. The button copies the label to clipboard so you can paste it into a labeler, and the output shows the amount of the reagent you'll make each time you complete the recipe in units.<br>The steps are formatted in a (usually) standardised way. I don't care enough to explain each part of it, so here's an obscenely detailed explanation on how to make Salicylic Acid.<br>
    <br>
    - 10 Carbon/Oxygen/Sugar/Hydrogen/Sulfur, 20 Oxygen | Beaker 1<br>
    - 30 Sugar | Beaker 1 -> ChemMaster<br>
    <br>
    Firstly, we add 10u of Carbon, Oxygen, and Sugar to the beaker/jug/shaker/whateverthefuckelse to make 30 Inaprovaline. We then add 10u of Hydrogen and Sulfur, and 20u Oxygen to the beaker to make 30u Sulfuric Acid. We mix this with 30u Sugar to make 90u Tranexamic Acid. We drag this beaker onto the ChemMaster in order to transfer its contents to the buffer for use later.<br>
    <br>
    - 30 Fluorine/Hydrogen/Potassium | Beaker 1 -> Jug 1<br>
    - 10 Hydrogen/Sulfur, 20 Oxygen | Beaker 1 -> Jug 1 -> ChemMaster<br>
    <br>
    As Fluorosulfuric Acid is a four-ingredient reagent because fuck you and we need 120u (we don't) because fuck you, we have to either mix in a jug or do two beakermixes. I have chosen the jug not because it's optimal, because it isn't, but because it's more convenient for my narrative.<br>We mix 30u of Fluorine, Hydrogen, and Potassium in a beaker and transfer all of its contents to the jug, do a 30u Sulfuric Acid beakermix and transfer it to the jug, and then drag the contents of the jug (120u Fluorosulfuric Acid) to the ChemMaster.<br>
    <br>
    - 25 Oxygen/Hydrogen | Beaker 1, Heat, Discard 5u<br>
    - 45 Sodium | Beaker 1 -> ChemMaster<br>
    <br>
    As we need and arbitrary 90u of Sodium Hydroxide instead of 100u, we need to discard part of our Hydrodide mix to compensate. You get the drill by now. 25u of Oxygen and Hydrogen into a beaker, heat that bitch and get rid of five units through either discarding it through the ChemMaster, dumping it into the ChemMaster, drinking it, or transferring 5u to another beaker and tossing it at the CMO. Mix this with 45u Sodium for 90u Sodium Hydroxide.<br>
    <br>
    - 15 Sugar/Oxygen, 60 Carbon | Beaker 1 -> ChemMaster<br>
    - 25 Tranexamic Acid/Fluorosulfuric Acid/Sodium Hydroxide/Bicaridine | Beaker 1, Heat -> Jug 1<br>
    - Repeat until expended<br>
    <br>
    standard 90u bicaridine beakermix, dump into master, lavabeaker because we don't have time to heat that shit and mix 25 tranex/fluorosulf/sodium hydrox/bicar from the ChemMaster, dump into the jug and label
