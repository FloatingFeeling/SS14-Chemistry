    Unlike Wizden, GS14 chemistry is focused around reagents with massive recipe trees and complex conditions to induce mixing. This means that the disparity between a chud like you who has this guide and someone who doesn't is extremely high, as they're going to have to naviagate through 30 different menus to find the recipe for sulfuric acid while you have to do none of that. I've already gone over why I fucking hate the guidebook, but the problem is so obscenely worse here I couldn't not mention it. So, congrats. <br>Despite this, most of the new meds are rather intuitive in their precursors. Artiplates, the bloodloss med, consists of tranex and saline, along with the two metals blood is based off of (iron and copper).<br>These new chems are split into tiers, with the originals being T1 or T2, and the Core Meds being T3. There are also T4 chems, which are exclusively made with Aluite (a pain in the ass, so I don't do it much). If I remember correctly, this also affects how it reacts to different severity wounds in woundmed, but we're a chemist so we don't care.<br>Additionally, Oil and Ammonia are used so frequently that I don't care nor have the time needed to include mixes for it in every recipe. And Ammonia scales by 20. I'm not dealing with that shit.<br>Make them in advance. You can beakermix 100 Ammonia with 25 Nitrogen and 75 Hydrogen, and 75 Oil with 25 Welding Fuel, Carbon, and Oxygen. Fucking off to maints roundstart isn't optional.

    <h3>Core Meds</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Salicyic Acid - Brute.</b> Acts like a combination of the Advanced Brutes. Plummets in effectiveness when the target has 25 or less damage, but we're a chemist so we don't care.</li>
      <li><b>Oxandrolone - Burn.</b> The same, for burns. Also heals caustic.</li>
      <li><b>Artiplates - Bloodloss, Blood Level.</b> Better saline with QOL in the form of stong bloodloss heal. Ashes at >520k, so make sure the patient isn't.</li>
      <li><b><del>Tirimol</del> <ins>Dex+</ins> - Airloss.</b> Don't bother with Tirimol. I originally wrote out a multiple page document on every reason Why This Reagent Fucking Sucks but realised I was crashing out over a game from 2003 and abstained it.</li>
      <li><b>Pentenic Acid - Toxin, Purges Bloodstream.</b> Requires 30 Plasma for a full batch. Somehow, reinforced table deconstructing returned.</li>
      <li><b>Atropine - Stabiliser.</b> Epi if it wasn't shit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stimulants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Aranesp.</b> Has no reason to exist. Its only benefit over Dylometh before the "buff" was the omni healing. AND THAT WAS REMOVED.</li>
        <li><b>Desoxyephedrine.</b> Meth. Mix 1/1 with Dylovene to nullify the poison. Objectively the best stimulant in nearly every category.</li>
        <li><b>Hyperzine.</b> Ever wanted to spend TC on something you could Just Fucking Make Before? Now you can! Buy the Chemical Synthesis Kit today!</li>
        <li><b>Tramadol.</b> Strong painkiller, precursor solution for Oxycodone, but that requires talking to botany so it's never made.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toxins and Pyrotechnics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Anacea.</b> The nukie killer. Neutralises medicine in the bloodstream and has an extremely low metabolisation rate. Agents don't bring Pentenic.</li>
        <li><b>Triclor.</b> Slows the target, makes them hurl their guts out and does decent blunt. Useful in deathmixes, though the vomiting can make it counterintuitive</li>
        <li><b>Fentanyl.</b> Fucking runs your shit. 5u and you're spasming on the floor for the next 15 minutes IGT. Genuinely horrifying but limited by a grocery list of ingredients that you have to go side quest to get. Does lethal, slow poison.</li>
        <li><b>Herignis.</b> A burn med cosplaying as phlogiston. Increases body temp when metabolised, acting as a catalyst for CLF3 and Black Powder gibmixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aluite Derivatives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ebifin - Burn.</b> Actually pretty decent. Acts like instant Oxandrolone, though a 3u OD means we dilute it with 2/5 such anyways. Requires gold.</li>
        <li><b>Procenyl Lazide - Brute.</b> Worse Salicylic. It's dogshit. Don't make this.</li>
        <li><b>Syriniver - Poison.</b> This shit is so ass...<br>Let me explain how utterly fucking useless this med is because it deserves its own section.<br>Despite being the T4 Toxin med, it doesn't heal Radiation. It also doesn't purge the bloodstream in any capacity.<br>For every 3u injected, it heals 30 Poison damage total. Its precursor solution, Diphenhydramine, heals 30 Poison damage per 5u.<br>We need to dilute this shit with Diphen because of the 3u overdose.<br>The literal med that it is created from is as good, if not better than the med itself, due to the lack of OD and lack of Aluite or Silver requirement.<br>Dylovene, a three element poison medication with a 20u overdose, heals 15 Poison for every five units. Ten units of Dylo is equivalent healing to Syriniver.<br>I genuinely wish that the person who created this blows their brains out with a Kammerer.</li>
