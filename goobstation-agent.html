    <h3>
      <strong>Why use mixes instead of pure Sali/Oxan/Arti/etc.</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>This is due to how chemical metabolisation works. <br> Currently, on Goobstation, there is no limit to how many reagents in the medical category can be metabolised at once. This means, compared to Wizden, where mixing different meds together would reduce the overall efficiency of the healing (due to being bottlenecked by the 3 cap and having to work through the jungle juice of meds in the bloodstream). <br> While we can just pump the Commander full of, like, fifteen different types of heroin and he'll be fine. <br> Although mixes are generally less efficient for across-the-board healing, due to using precursor chemicals or stuff that's usually not used (due to being straight up worse), it's twice as fast, which is the only thing that we care about. <br> The efficiency cut can also be bypassed by just. Carrying more meds, because you're damn sure going to have a surplus when you're lacing your shit half and half. It's not like you're using your bag space for anything else. <br> If you don't like being unefficient with meds, either don't use mixes at all or split the mix into two jugs. It's less fast, but it's personal preference. I don't care. </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>Why are the labels different.</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>Because 90% of Nukies have no idea what "OD" means and it's better just to tell them how many times to stick you if you're bleeding out. <br> Just yell at them roundstart to hit you with the top left one, where you should be putting sali. </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>Why make Dylometh.</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We get enough Ephedrine roundstart to make 540 Desoxyephedrine, or 1080 Fucking Dylometh. It's literally one heat away. It's free Hyperzine. Why wouldn't you.</p>
